# DeepSDF: Learning Continuous Signed Distance Functions for Shape Representation

# Method Summary

- Introduce a method of **parametrizing signed distance function** representing shapes of objects with neural network.
- Use **audo-decoder** for learning latent space of each shapes instead of fitting the network to each instance belonging to some category **â†’ Compact, and generalizable!**
