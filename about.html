<p>Welcome! I'm Seungwoo Yoo, a student majoring CS & EE at <b>KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology)</b>.</p>

<p>I'm interested in various fields of computer science such as computer graphics, computer vision, and recently arising deep learning as a breakthrough
    for traditional computing problems.</p>

<p>Currently, I'm participating an internship at <a href="https://mhsung.github.io/">KAIST 3D AI LAB</a> led by Prof. Minhyuk Sung. 
    As an intern, I'm dedicating myself studying & investigating methods to solve long-time problems, especially arose in the middle 
    of computer graphics and vision, with clever neural rendering techniques.</p>

<p>You can see my CV <a href="/assets/CV.pdf">here</a>.</p>
