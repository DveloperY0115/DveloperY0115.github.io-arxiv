<h1 id="method-summary">Method Summary</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Introduce a method of <strong>parametrizing signed distance function</strong> representing shapes of objects with neural network.</li>
  <li>Use <strong>audo-decoder</strong> for learning latent space of each shapes instead of fitting the network to each instance belonging to some category <strong>â†’ Compact, and generalizable!</strong></li>
</ul>
